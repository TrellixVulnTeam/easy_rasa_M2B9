pipeline: the list of the :class:`rasa.nlu.components.Component`

所以pipeline 就是 nlu下的组件组成的list

那么自定义pipeline就是自定义如何 实现 rasa.nlu.components.Component

```
    """A component is a message processing unit in a pipeline.

    Components are collected sequentially in a pipeline. Each component
    is called one after another. This holds for
    initialization, training, persisting and loading the components.
    If a component comes first in a pipeline, its
    methods will be called first.

    E.g. to process an incoming message, the ``process`` method of
    each component will be called. During the processing
    (as well as the training, persisting and initialization)
    components can pass information to other components.
    The information is passed to other components by providing
    attributes to the so called pipeline context. The
    pipeline context contains all the information of the previous
    components a component can use to do its own
    processing. For example, a featurizer component can provide
    features that are used by another component down
    the pipeline to do intent classification.

```
 这段进行了完整的解释，所谓pipeline 就是多个component组成的列表，并且会被
 一个接着一个进行执行。

 第一放入pipeline的 component 会被第一个执行
