slots：官网解读
       Slots are bot·s memory。是以key-vale形式存储，能够用来存储用户提供的信息、或者一定规则提取的信息

       比如 和用户聊天中，你需要知道用户所在城市，你可以用 text类型定义一个 slot 命名为 home_city

       slot 类型有 bool，text, list ,当你不知道何种类型使用  unfeaturized

定义slot
slots:
  name:
    type: text
    initial_value: "human"

actions.py 中如何使用
data = tracker.get_slot("slot-name")



happy_paths - situations where the user provides all the required information and lets the
assistant drive the conversation

Once the form acton `restaurant_form` get predicted, the assistant keeps asking for necessary
detail until all required slots are set.

There are no  restrictions in the initial restaurant request, for example, 'book me a table for
two at the chinese restaurant', the assistant will keep the questions about the cuisine and
number of people.


## happy path
* greet
    - utter_greet
* request_restaurant
    - restaurant_form
    - form{"name": "restaurant_form"}
    - form{"name": null}
    - utter_slots_values
* thankyou
    - utter_noworries



 step 3: defining the domain
 in order to train the dialogue management model with RASA, you also need to define the domin.
 this is where you can specify which extracted details should be stored as slots.


 In rasa, different slot types have a different influence on the predictions of the next action,
 when using FormAction to fill the slots, you are enforcing strict rules which tell your assistant
 what information it should ask for next.

 the names of templates which will be used to ask for the missing required slots should
 follow the format `utter_ask_{slotname}`. This is important for FormAction to know which
 template to use for which slot.



This is where the slot_mappings function in a FormAction comes in play - it defines how to extract slot values from possible user responses and maps them to a specific slot. Below is an example of the slot_mappings function for the previously discussed outdoor_seating slot. Based on the defined logic, the outdoor_seating slot will be populated using either:
